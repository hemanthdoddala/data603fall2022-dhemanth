<h4>Question 1</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Big Data with example and types</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>As the name suggests big data is collection of large volumes of data.Though the data is already huge and it keeps increasing over time exponentially.</li>
    <li>
        The data is so big that traditional databases or databasement systems cannot handle data efficiently and effectively.
    </li>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <li>Social Media Data, Stock Exchange data, Data of streaming platforms like youtube</li>
    <h5>Types of Big Data:</h5>
    <li>Structured</li>
    <li>Unstructured</li>
    <li>Semi Structured</li>
    <b>Structured:</b>
    <li>Data is in a structured format and schema of the data is already known.</li>
    <b>Unstructured:</b>
    <li>Structure or the schema of the data is not known or classified.</li>
    <b>Semi Structured:</b>
    <li>This kind of data contains both structured and unstructured data.The best example for this is xml data</li>
</ul>

<h4>Question 2</h4>
<p>6 ‘V’s of Big Data </p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Volume:</b></li>
    <p>This V talks about volume of the data and it is quite obvious feature of big data. Data is always growing and companies like youtube, netflix and tiktok increases very rapidly.</p>
    <li><b>Variety:</b></li>
    <p>This is about types of data that needs to processed and analysed. Data can in multiple formats like json, xml, blob, image, video etc.</p>
    <li><b>Velocity:</b></li>
    <p>This is about the speed at which the data is generated or change in change in data.</p>
    <li><b>Value:</b></li>
    <p>value is about return on investment of data when stored and processed or value of the data when stored and analysed</p>
    <li><b>Veracity:</b></li>
    <p>Veracity is about quality and origin of the data.</p>
    <li><b>Variability:</b></li>
    <p>To what extent how fast the structure of the data is changing is called as variability of data.</p>
</ol>

<h4>Question 3</h4>
Phases of Big Data analysis
<ol>
    <li>Data Acquisition</li>
    <p>Data is identified and gathered from different sources. Data can come from variety of sources such as relational databases, data lakes and datawarehouses</p>
    <li>Data Extraction</li>
    <p>Data acquired can be in different formats and required data is extracted from the acquired data.</p>
    <li>Data Munging(Validation and Cleaning)</li>
    <p>data extracted can be in unstructured or in unusable format for data analaysis, in this phase data is checked for errors and errors are rectified such as filling null values, removing unnecessary data.</p>
    <li>Data Aggregation & Representation(Storage)</li>
    Data can speared across multiple datasets or in multiple formats, this data is aggregated and represented in format that is bussiness is expecting.
    <li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
    After the data is aggregated then using various tools data is analysed to see all insights in the data. This phase helps us understand about data.
    <li>Data Visualization(Preparation for Modeling and Assessment)</li>
    <p>Visualization is the best way to understand data. Finally data is visualized to see all the insights.</p>
</ol>

<h4>Question 4:</h4>
Challenges in Big Data analysis
<li>Lack of knowledge Professionals</li>
To run these cutting-edge innovations and enormous data, organizations need talented information experts. One of the difficulties any Organization face is absence of huge Information experts
<li>Data Growth Issues</li>
Biggest challenge is storing the huge volume of data. And also the volume of data is growing over a period of time exponentially and most of the data generated or produced is unstructured data. 
<li>Confusion while Big Data Tool selection</li>
Organizations frequently get confounded while choosing the least complex tool for data analysis and storage.Organizations often find themselves in using wrong tools and making inappropriate decisions.
<li>Integrating Data from a Spread of Sources</li>
Data can be coming from various and it would be a huge challenge to integrate and analyse the data that is spread across various sources.
